    displayed on either axis. Hover over the markers for more information about a player. To query a sub-set of players
    interact with the legend and the widgets on the left. Ratios (such as goals per shot), percentages and minutes are
    always shown as totals, all other values can be shown as totals or per minute. To highlight a player click on their
    marker or enter their name into the search box. Percentiles and distribution plots are calculated for players with
    over 1350 minutes played and are always per minute, except for ratios and minutes. Name labels can be added or
    removed using the bottom selection widget.
